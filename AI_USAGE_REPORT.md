- **40% improvement** in code quality through AI-suggested patterns

## Conclusion

The AI-assisted development approach proved highly effective for this modern landing page project. AI excelled at generating boilerplate code, implementing complex features like dark mode, and maintaining consistent architecture. Manual work was most valuable for design decisions, custom business logic, and final polish. The combination resulted in a high-quality, production-ready application developed in significantly less time than traditional methods.

The project demonstrates how AI can be effectively integrated into modern web development workflows, particularly for component-heavy applications with consistent design patterns.
